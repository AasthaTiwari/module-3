            Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture, which includes cuisine originating from the diverse regions of China, as well as from Overseas Chinese who have settled in other parts of the world. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide.

            Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism, cultural choices and traditions.The cuisine is also influenced by centuries of Islamic rule, particularly the Mughal rule. Samosas and pilafs are examples.

            Italian cuisine is mainly characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only two to four main ingredients.Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation.Ingredients and dishes vary by region. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated with variations throughout the country.Significant changes occurred with the colonization of the Americas and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, capsicums, maize and sugar beet, this last introduced in quantity in the 18th century.
